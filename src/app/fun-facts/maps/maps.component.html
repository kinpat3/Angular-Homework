<h1>Brief History on Maps Function</h1>

<blockquote>
    Maps are designed as an alternative to using Object literals for storing key/value 
    pairs that require unique keys, and provide very useful methods for iteration.
    The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. 
    The map() method calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order. 
    Note: map() does not execute the function for array elements without values.
