<h1>Brief History on Weakmap & Weakset Function</h1>

<blockquote>
    Keys of WeakMaps are of the type Object only. Primitive data types as keys are not allowed 
    (e.g. a Symbol can't be a WeakMap key). A map API could be implemented in JavaScript with two 
    arrays (one for keys, one for values) shared by the four API methods. Setting elements on this map 
    would involve pushing a key and value onto the end of each of those arrays simultaneously. 
    As a result, the indices of the key and value would correspond to both arrays. Getting values from the 
    map would involve iterating through all keys to find a match, then using the index of this match to 
    retrieve the corresponding value from the array of values. Such an implementation would have two main 
    inconveniences. The first one is an O(n) set and search (n being the number of keys in the map) 
    since both operations must iterate through the list of keys to find a matching value. The second 
    inconvenience is a memory leak because the arrays ensure that references to each key and each value are 
    maintained indefinitely. These references prevent the keys from being garbage collected, even if there are no other 
    references to the object. This would also prevent the corresponding values from being garbage collected.
    By contrast, native WeakMaps hold "weak" references to key objects, which means that they do not prevent 
    garbage collection in case there would be no other reference to the key object. This also avoids preventing
    garbage collection of values in the map. Native WeakMaps can be particularly useful constructs when mapping keys to 
    information about the key that is valuable only if the key has not been garbage collected. Because of references being weak, WeakMap keys are not enumerable (i.e. there is no method giving you a list of the keys). If they were, the list would depend on the state of garbage collection, introducing non-determinism. If you want to have a list of keys, you should use a Map.
    WeakSet objects are collections of objects. An object in the WeakSet may occur only once; it is 
    unique in the WeakSet's collection. The main differences to the Set object are: In contrast to Sets, 
    WeakSets are collections of objects only and not of arbitrary values of any type. The WeakSet is weak: 
    References to objects in the collection are held weakly. If there is no other reference to an object 
    stored in the WeakSet, they can be garbage collected. That also means that there is no list of current 
    objects stored in the collection. WeakSets are not enumerable.
