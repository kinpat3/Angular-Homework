<h1>Brief History on Classes Function</h1>

<blockquote>
        ES6 Classes formalize the common JavaScript pattern of simulating class-like inheritance hierarchies using functions and prototypes. 
        They are effectively simple sugaring over prototype-based OO, offering a convenient declarative form for class patterns which encourage interoperability.
        Classes (as shipped in Chrome) support prototype-based inheritance, constructors, super calls, instance and static methods. The samples included in this demo are:
        Creating a new class (declaration-form),
        Creating a new class (expression-form),
        Extending an existing class,
        Subclassing methods of a parent class,
        Defining static methods,
        Subclassing built-ins,
